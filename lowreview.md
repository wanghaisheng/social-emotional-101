1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 What it’s not: Fun or innovative.
2024年2月29日 在美国审核
样式: 社交情景已确认购买
My son (8) struggles with social-emotional situations. He’s both insecure and volatile. I purchased the “Social Situations” card deck for 3-6th graders thinking we could have fun while learning.
What I thought I was getting was a game of sorts—I guess it was the deck of 52 cards that threw me—where players would explore potential social scenarios—perhaps some silly—and that the game would ultimately “reward” answers that would lead players to a better social outcome, thereby being a fun activity while also prompting player reflection.
No. What we have here are 52 (granted, thoughtful) social situations that a child might encounter, with prompts on the bottom of each card, such as, “How does that make you feel?,” or “What would you do?.”
In my house, that type of activity is simply what we do at the dinner table—a parent reflecting with her kiddo on what happened (or could happen) at school or with friends.
I forked out 25 bucks for cards because I thought someone had figured out how to make social reflection FUN. It was a bad bet.
Alas, there’s no real innovation here, folks. Save yourself some money: Every day invent a hypothetical social situation that might cause your child some confusion or discomfort in real life. Pose this situation to your child, and ask how s/he, they might handle it. Throw in words like “fart,” “toilet,” “booger.” You have now saved yourself $25, and your child will have had more fun than if they had “played” with this product.
That’s my 2 cents.

1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 Way overpriced for what you get!

I cannot believe these cards are priced at 25.00 bucks considering you get no solutions to manage your crisis situation or develop your critical thinking skills. You're better off doing an internet search or asking for solutions in an online chat forum.

I returned these useless cards for a refund because they offer nothing except scenarios. Yeah, I've been in plenty of crisis scenarios and scenarios where I needed to critically think about something but how am I supposed to manage or develop these skills with no additional tools or possible solutions?

I can't believe these are so highly rated. I kept going through the cards thinking I'd missed something but no. They're simply scenario cards and nothing more.

Save your money!

4 star deduction for these get-rich-quick cards simply because the creator wants to make an easy buck and thinks her ivy league college education is what makes these cards innovative and worth having.

1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 Good Questions, but NO Answers? Small Playing Card sized
2022年11月2日 在美国审核
样式: 社交技能已确认购买
Maybe this is just me, but I was expecting a learning tool - a set of questions and answers.

Instead, I seem to have received a small pack of playing cards filled with tiny text asking (thought provoking & good) questions, but then offering no guidance on the appropriate answer/action.

Even as a (mature?) adult, some of the uncomfortable social situations described, left me at a loss as to how to advise my young daughter to deal with!

They’re the actual size of playing cards, which I’d probably known if I’d read the description more fully! There’s a lot of tiny text crammed onto some of these cards, would have been better if they were bigger, or the questions used fewer words.

Example (not verbatim) “A boy points at your shoes and tells you they’re baby shoes, laughs at you, then makes some other insult - how do you react? What do you say and do?”

1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 provides no actual solutions; deck poses scenarios, offers zero psychological viewpoints.
2023年4月26日 在美国审核
样式: 社交技能已确认购买
This entire deck provides no professional, anecdotal or any other type of help. Literally all this is in scenarios being posed and follow up questions for children and care givers about their feelings and potential actions about a situation. What this really needs is professional readings and input or help about what actions, behaviors, feelings are appropriate/helpful or what actions, ways of thinking help with any and each given scenario. I could have made this deck.. it's the things i cannot do that i was hoping this deck could provide help with, but did not.

Just Returned it. Nicely packaged in a metal tin ... but totally useless. I was excited by the idea of a card deck about critical thinking and was excited to order ... but the actual product was a complete disappointment. Others might find it interesting but it did nothing for me ... And I am into the idea of critical thinking - think we need more of this in our society.

If you are going to offer flashcards defining components of critical thinking, then your explanations must be concise and accurate. These cards dumb down the concepts while using too many words doing it. C'mon, developers, you can do better...

1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 Too many mistakes
2021年12月7日 在美国审核
样式: 批判性思维免费商品的 Vine 买家评论( 这是什么？ )
I opened this set with an expectation of pleasure, but on my first exploratory thumb through I immediately found the following:

- Moral Credential Effect (seven of hearts): " We've been honest and good that we permit ourselves to be less good in the future.' This should be "We've been SO honest and good ...", and is not supposed to be a general change of attitude, just a license for individual acts.

- Fundamental Attribution Error (four of spades): "We judge others on their personality or character, but judge ourselves on the situation." No, actually it means that we ATTRIBUTE other's actions to FUNDAMENTAL characteristics like character and personality, but we ATTRIBUTE our own actions to our situation.

- Dunning-Kruger Effect (four of diamonds): "The less we know, the more confident we are. The more we know, the less confident we are." No, self assessment versus knowledge is actually a curve that starts high, goes sharply downward, but then gradually rises back up again.

I haven't read through the whole deck and I don't intend to. If that's making a conclusion based on incomplete data, so be it.

1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 Negative Pattern Critical Race Theory Trojan Horse
2022年1月27日 在美国审核
样式: 对话技巧
Negative patterning is when scenarios are deliberately set up to manipulate users into choices they do not want to make. This is common in sales situations and employers often use negative patterns to manipulate employees into accepting scenarios they would not willingly have chosen, etc. This tool hides radical progressive ideology and child programming with contested philosophical underpinnings in a tool for teaching children basic emotional and social skills. This includes notions of systemic bias and behaviors which become correct only on begging the question in relation to the same. If you look more closely at the images above you'll see the 'equity and inclusion' keywords that signal content intended to program children to discriminate on the basis of race and make both positive and negative predeterminations about life and fairness on that basis rather than individual circumstances and character.

ADD mom with more than I bargained for.
Didn’t catch that printing at home would be required. Seemingly involved ‘game’ to encourage motivation / but seems more like an additional chore. Great tool, but, Would’ve been wonderful if everything required came in a packet. Perhaps I’m not up to the challenge, so, will resort to doing it the old fashioned way.

样式: 批判性思维已确认购买
The cards are nicely made though the content is weak, from the perspective of logic and linguistics. For a pop approach, however, the cards can be useful, and perhaps in the right circumstances fun, but if you really want to learn about informal fallacies and the logic of thinking, study the topic from a well-reviewed book on the subject...

The cards categorize common tricky situations and pose the situation as a good question, but your on your own regarding a solution/answer. For the cost of the card the value isn’t there. The scenarios are good because they are tricky social situations, but professional guidance/ recommendations would better support this price point. I would pass on this.

2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 A Good Idea in Theory but not Well-executed
2023年9月19日 在美国审核
样式: 包容技巧免费商品的 Vine 买家评论( 这是什么？ )
This card deck was rather confusing and disappointing for me. The idea as described seemed sound enough, for looking at the cards themselves their purpose is not as salient as I would have hoped.

For some reason, I had expected to get cards that would be like flash cards to help educate others and inspire thoughtful conversation. The premise that these can spark 52 conversations is a stretch, given that the cards have two for each concept or vocabulary term, meaning there are in actual fact 26 possibilities.

The icons for the suits of the cards were designed confusingly: the hearts, clubs, etc look like little emojis with their limbs and faces. I didn’t catch on that this was a deck of playing cards right away, that’s how unobvious that part of the design is. The QR codes do lead to interesting personal stories, but playing a basic card game doesn’t really lend itself to whipping out your phone and stopping to read them. And doing so potentially shows others your cards, which is often something you don’t want to do while playing a card game.

From a disability advocacy and self-advocacy standpoint, I cannot recommend this deck. The emphasis seems to be exclusively on medical disabilities and had no obvious mention of the differences between the social model of disability and the medical model. Perhaps this deck’s simply out of date.

Anyway, I’d say back to the drawing board with this one.

2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星 Awkward
2022年7月24日 在美国审核
样式: 对话技巧
I got this to enhance my pre-teen’s social skills before starting middle school. Thought it would be a fun game for a good family time. Turns out just a bunch of cards with questions written in a way that does not nearly resemble a freely flowing social conversation. More like grilling someone in a radio interview.
The topics and questions are boring not only for kids but for adults too. There is no fun element or interesting twist or smart catch in this game. Like a script for a bunch of nerds. No one with good social skills talks like that in real life.
Reminded me of a night at a loud bar when a guy was awkwardly trying to flirt with my very pretty and single friend (who did not mind a bit of fun and flirting). When she told him (answering his questions) that she works in energy business, he found nothing better to ask than « What is your view on the future of the oil price? ». In a serious tone, like in an interview on Bloomberg radio.
